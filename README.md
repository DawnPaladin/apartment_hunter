# City Stats

Considering various places you might move to? This tool can help.

This app uses the [Open Data Network](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/) to look up statistics about various cities. You can compare any number of cities and download your data as a CSV. Once you have your CSV, you can set up color scales and take notes on the various cities.
